  Mod1-`              Alternate between shelf (if populated) and virtual
                      desktop contexts

  Mod1-s              Shelve the focused window without switching to the
                      shelf, adopting the newly shelved window as the
                      focused window within the shelf

* Mod1-Tab            Focus and raise the next window in the current
                      context (shelf or virtual desktop), the focused
                      window is not 'committed' as the MRU window until
                      Mod1 is released, so you may peruse intermediate
                      windows without affecting the order until releasing
                      Mod1.  In multihead configurations the next window
                      selection is confined to the current screen.

  Mod1-Shift-Tab      Identical to Mod1-Tab except switches to the MRU
		      window on another screen in a multihead configuration

  Mod1-d              Request the client destroy the focused window, or
                      destroy the current virtual desktop when no windows
                      exist on it

  Mod1-Shift-d        XKillClient the focused window (useful for
                      misbehaving clients)

  Mod1-Enter          Alternate between full-screen and windowed dimensions
                      for the focused window

                      of the screen [ left bottom quarter of screen ]

  Mod1-] [-]]         Reconfigure the focused window to fill the right half
                      of the screen [ right top quarter of screen ]

  Mod1-Shift-[ [-[]   Reconfigure the focused window to fill the top half
                      of the screen [ top left quarter of screen ]

  Mod1-Shift-] [-]]   Reconfigure the focused window to fill the bottom
                      half of the screen [ bottom right quarter of screen ]

  Mod1-Semicolon      Toggle monitoring overlays (when active vwm becomes a
                      compositing manager, which is slower)

  Mod1-Apostrophe     Discard the "snowflakes" region of the focused
                      window's monitoring overlay

  Mod1-Right          Increase monitoring frequency (when overlays are
                      active, too high a frequency can overload X)

  Mod1-Left           Decrease monitoring frequency, the lowest setting
                      halts monitoring)

  Mod1-Esc-Esc-Esc    Exit vwm (if vwm is the child of your X server, X
                      exits too, so your X clients all lose their
                      connection and die.  However, your clients are
                      running under screen, and if your X server didn't
                      exit, they won't lose their X connection.)

  *'s above indicate commands which initiate an MRU-update to be committed
      on the next Mod1 release.  One may traverse windows and desktops
      without affecting their MRU order by returning to the original
      initiating window and/or desktop before releasing Mod1.  This permits
      one to do quite a lot of things under a single, long-duration Mod1
      press only committing to a potentially different focused
      window/desktop at the very end.

      Think of the Mod1 release as a transaction commit when coupled with
      the *'d commands.

      If a simultaneous second Mod1 is pressed at any point during a *'d
      command, the window (and its desktop) focused when the *'d command
      began will immediately be refocused - but not raised.  This is
      intentional to simplify the arranging of obscured focused windows.  If
      you find yourself restored to a desktop full of windows where your
      focused window is totally obscured/invisible, simply press Mod1-k to
      raise it if desired.

      At any point during a *'d operation one may (re)press a second Mod1
      to return to the origin, it is not limited to a single use.

General:

  Newly created windows are raised but not focused unless they are the first
  window on an otherwise empty virtual desktop, then they are focused as well.
  When new windows appear on a populated virtual desktop, they are inserted
  immediately after the currently focused window in the windows list, so a
  Mod1-Tab will immediately focus new windows.  Windows are kept in a MRU (Most
  Recently Used) order, keeping it efficient to alternate between an evolving
  set of active windows.

  The shelf is a sort of omnipresent and limited virtual desktop always
  available via Mod1-`, it only shows a single window at a time, Mod1-Tab
  cycles through the shelved windows.  I use it as a place to stow xterms
  running backround processes I would like to retain the ability to observe the
  output of or interact with occasionally.  Programs like transmission-gtk,
  cmus, wpa_supplicant under xterm, sometimes even iceweasel sessions find
  themselves in my shelf on a regular basis.


Multihead/Xinerama:

  In multihead configurations new windows are placed on the screen containing
  the pointer if that screen is empty.  Should the pointer be on a non-empty
  screen, then new windows are placed on the screen containing the currently
  focused window.

  New windows will automatically be focused if the screen they were placed on
  is empty, even if their virtual desktop is not, which is a divergence from
  the single-headed behavior where only lone windows on virtual desktops are
  automatically focused.


Composite/Monitoring:

  One reason vwm was created was to provide a simplified platform for the
  research and development of a window manager with integrated omnipresent
  first-class local process monitoring.  Early attempts were made to modify an
  existing window manager (WindowMaker) which produced unsatisfactory though
  inspiring results.  The window managers vwm[12] were created shortly after to
  flesh out the interaction model and solidify an perfectly usable and easily
  modified window manager foundation, while libvmon was created in parallel to
  facilitate the efficient process monitoring required for such a task.

  After a number of iterations it was found that the Composite extension (along
  with the accompanying Damage and Render extensions) would give the best
  results on a modern Xorg linux system.  Compositing hurts the rendering
  performance of X applications significantly however, so a hybrid model has
  been employed.

  Monitoring overlays visibility is toggled using Mod1-Semicolon, the sample
  rate is increased using Mod1-Right, and decreased using Mod1-Left.

  When the monitoring is not visible, vwm3 continues to leave X in immediate
  rendering mode with no additional overhead in the rendering pipeline, just
  like vwm2.  The only additional overhead is the cost of regularly sampling
  process statistics and maintaining the state of window overlays (which does
  involve some X rendering of graphs and text, but does not introduce overhead
  to the drawing of client windows).

  When monitoring overlays are made visible vwm3 temporarily becomes a
  compositing manager, redirecting the rendering of all windows to offscreen
  memory and assuming the responsibility of drawing all damaged contents to the
  root window on their behalf.  This is what gives vwm3 the opportunity to draw
  alpha-blended contextual monitoring data over all of the windows, but it does
  come with a cost.

  Most modern GNU/Linux desktop environments are full-time composited, meaning
  all X clients are redirected at all times.  This makes their draws more
  costly and latent due to all the additional copies being performed.
  Depending on how things have been implemented, in the interests of supporting
  things like transparent windows it also generally results in overlapping
  window regions being drawn repeatedly for every overlapping window from the
  bottom-up rather than just the top one.

  In vwm3 transparent windows are not supported, and shape windows (xeyes) are
  made rectangular in composited mode.  This is so overlapping regions are only
  drawn once for the top windows having damage per burst of screen updates.

  Immediate rendering mode is restored upon disabling the monitoring overlays,
  restoring the drawing performance to vwm[12] levels where vwm3 is completely
  out of the drawing loop.

  Here are some relevant things worth noting:

  - The monitoring is only heirarchical if your kernel is configured with
    CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE, which seems to be common nowadays.  This is
    required for the /proc/$pid/task/$tid/children files, which is what
    libvmon uses to efficiently scope monitoring to just the descendants of
    the explicitly monitored client precesses.

  - tmux orphans its backend process immediately at startup, discarding its
    parent->child relationship, so you don't get any monitoring of the commands
    running in your local tmux session.  Use GNU screen instead.

  - GNU screen orphans its backend on detach, so on reattach you've lost the
    parent->child relationship and find yourself in the same situation tmux
    puts you in immediately.  I've developed an adopt() system call patch for
    the linux kernel to enable adopting orphans in this situation, but it
    hasn't been accepted.  With this patch and a one line change to GNU screen
    the parent->child relationship is restored on reattach.

    You may find patches for adding the adopt() system call to Linux and its
    integration into GNU screen in the patches/ subdirectory.

  - The top row of the overlays shows:

     Total CPU Idle % (cyan):
      The height of every cyan vertical line reflects the %age of ticks since
      the previous sample which were spent in the idle task.
    
     Total CPU IOWait % (red):
      The height of every red vertical line reflects the %age of ticks since
      the previous sample which were lost to IO wait.  Many people don't
      understand this correctly.  This reflects opportunities to execute
      something other than the idle task which were lost because _all_
      runnable tasks at the time were blocked in IO.

      An absence of IOWait does not mean nothing is blocked on IO.  It just
      means there weren't opportunities to execute something which were lost due
      to waiting on IO.

      For example, lets say you have a dual core machine, and you launch two
      "yes > /dev/null &" commands.  These two yes commands are essentially busy
      loops writing "yes" to /dev/null, they will always be runnable, and you
      will see a top row in the overlay devoid of any cyan _or_red_ while they
      execute.

      While they execute run something like:
      "sudo echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && du /"

      Still no IOWait in the top row.  We know that du is blocking on IO, the
      caches are empty, but because there is always something runnable on the
      two cores thanks to the two yes commands, we'll never see IOWait.  The
      other runnable processes mask the IOWait from our visibility.

      Now kill the two yes commands and rerun the du command, watch the top
      row.  Some red should appear, the red indicates that there was CPU time
      available for running something, and the _only_ things available for that
      time was blocked in IO.  Had there something else runnable, we wouldn't
      see the time lost to IOWait.

      When you see IOWait time, it's just saying nothing executed for that
      time, not for lack of any runnable tasks, just that all runnable tasks
      were blocked.  It's still of value, but easily obscured on a system with
      any cpu-bound tasks constantly running.

  - The per-task (processes or threads) rows of the overlays show:

     User CPU % (cyan):
      The height of every cyan vertical line reflects the %age of ticks since
      the previous sample which were spent executing this task in the user
      context.

     System CPU % (red):
      The height of every red vertical line reflects the %age of ticks since
      the previous sample which were spent executing this task in kernel/system
      context.

     Task monitoring beginning and ending is indicated with solid and checkered
     vertical bars, respectively.  These generally coincide with the task clone
     and exit, but not always, especially the cloning.

  - You can pause sampling by lowering its rate (Mod1-Left) to 0Hz.  Just be
    aware that this also pauses the updating of the overlay contents, so window
    resizes won't be adapted to in the overlay until increasing the sample rate
    (Mod1-Right).  Pausing is useful if you've seen something interesting and
    would like to screenshot, study, or discuss.  BTW, to take a screenshot
    when composited you have to capture the root window.  If you capture the
    client window, you won't get the overlays, you'll just get the redirected
    window contents.  Compositing mode composites everything into the root
    window, when you're interacting with the composited vwm3, you're looking at
    the root window the entire time.

  - The sample rate will automatically be lowered by vwm3 when it detects that
    it's having trouble maintaining the current one.  If you have many windows
    or have a slow or heavily loaded processor/GPU they can become bottlenecks,
    especially at higher sample rates.  Rather than continuing to bog down your
    X server (Xorg is not good at fairly scheduling clients under GPU
    contention), vwm3 will simply back off the sample rate as if you had hit
    Mod1-Left, to try ameliorate rather than exacerbate the situation.

  - The monitoring is implemented using sampling, not tracing.  Below the
    current process heirarchy for every window there is an exited tasks
    snowflakes section filling the remaining space.  Do not mistake this for
    something lossless like bash history or strace output, it's lossy since
    it's produced from sampled data.  In part to try avoid interpretation of
    these as a reliable process history I refer to them as snowflakes in the
    code, since they fall downwards and sideways.

    With sufficiently high sample rates the output starts to take on the
    appearance of tracing, and while it may happen to capture every process in
    slower executions, most automata will execute entire commands in the time
    between samples.  So try keep this in mind before thinking something's
    broken because you don't see something you expected in the snowflakes.

    Some artifacts you might notice due to this which are not bugs are:

     - "#missed it!"  being shown as the command name, this happens when
       libvmon caught the process but the process exited before libvmon caught
       a sample of the name.

     - A parent's command name in the child when a different command was
       executed.  In UNIX systems processes fork before execing the new
       command, in that window of time between the fork and exec, the child
       process is a clone of the parent, command and argv included.  Sometimes
       the sample catches at just the right moment to see this in action.

     - Varying outputs in seeming identical actions.  Things like simply
       launching xterm may produce no snowflakes at all in the new xterm, or a
       few like "bash" "dircolors -b" and "utempter add :0", especially if you
       have the sample rate turned up and cause some load on the system to slow
       the xterm and interactive bash startup scripts down.
    
  - In the interests of being efficient, nothing is being logged historically.
    The snowflakes area is all you get, which is limited to the free pixel
    space below the instantaneous process heirarchy within the window.

    Everything which falls off the edges of the screen is lost forever, with
    the exception of windows which have been made smaller than they were.

    You cannot scroll down or to the right to see older snowflakes or graphs.

    You cannot search the snowflakes.

    The native text and numeric representations of the sampled data is not kept
    any longer than the current sample, just long enough to update the
    overlays.  From that point on the information exists only as visualized
    pixels in the overlay layers with no additional indexing or relationships
    being maintained with the currently monitored state.

  - You can wipe the snowflakes of the focused window with Mod1-Apostrophe

  - The client PID is found via the _NET_WM_PID X property.  This must be set
    by the client, and not all clients cooperate (xpdf is one I've noticed).

    This is annoying especially considering the vast majority of X clients run
    on modern systems are local clients connected via UNIX domain sockets.
    These sockets support ancillary messages including SCM_CREDENTIALS, which
    contains the pid of the connected process.  Some investigation into the
    Xorg sources found it already queries this information and has it on hand,
    but doesn't bother setting the _NET_WM_PID property even though it's well-
    positioned to do so.

    I've developed and submitted upstream a patch for Xorg which sets
    _NET_WM_PID on local connections, it complements vwm3 nicely.

    You can find the patch in the patches directory.

  - There are around 5 files kept open in /proc for every task monitored by
    vwm.  This applies to children processes and threads alike, so on a busy
    system it's not unrealistic to exceed 1024, a common default open files
    ulimit for GNU/Linux distributions.  You can generally change this limit
    for your user via configuration in /etc/security/limits.conf or
    /etc/security/limits.d/.
